# Frontend Mentor - News homepage solution

This is a solution to the [News homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

Note: this project was only for training myself and is not meant to be for production, so I didn't optimize the project in terms of clean code, performance, accessbility, etc..
